This module mimics a [Web Remote](https://help.malighting.com/grandMA2/en/help/key_remote_control_web_remote.html) to interface with grandMA2.  
  
## Features
#### Sending
Using a FPS filter to limit the maximum rate of any send mappings is highly recommended.  

- Executor fader value (Float)*
- Button push state (Bool)
- Set Executor Label (String)
- Send Command (String)
     
  *Due to MA2 being able to fully lock up with very high request rates, sending of the fader value has a module sided rate limit.

    ###### Planned
  - Executor Color (Appearance)
  - Executor Button Function (Assign)

#### Receiving
- Executor Label (String)
- Executor Run State (Bool)
- Executor Button Text (String)
- Executor Color (Color)
- Executor Fader Value (Float) (Faders Only)
- Executor Fader Text (String) (Faders Only)
- Executor Fader Value (String) (Faders Only)

  ###### Planned
  - Executor Cue List
 
## Setting up grandMA2  

If you have not used the MA2 Web Remote before, you will need to enable it first.

Enable it by setting `Setup > Console > Global Settings > Remotes` to `Login Enabled`

By default, the module is configured to login with the user `chataigne` and the password `chataigne`.  
Either create this user profile, or use your own or an existing one by changing the modules default login settings.  

To create / manage a user account in MA2, go to `Setup > Console > User & Profiles Setup`.

Please note that the password field in the Module needs to be a MD5 hash of the password you set in MA2.  
You can use any [MD5 hash generator](https://www.md5hashgenerator.com) to generate the hash of the password. (Careful not to include extra spaces!)  

In this section you can also later monitor / verify that the module is connected correctly.

This should change from `guest` to your configured user, when the module logs into the session.
